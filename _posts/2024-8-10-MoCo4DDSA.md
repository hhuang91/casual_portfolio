4D-DSA offers time-resolved 3D information of contrast concentration in vascular structures and has seen increased use in the neuro-interventional suite. Most current approaches to 4D-DSA are implemented using interventional cone-beam CT systems and involve the acquisition of a non-contrast-enhanced reference mask and a contrast-enhanced volume during contrast administration. The final 4D-DSA dataset is obtained under assumptions of perfect stationarity of the patient during both CBCT scans. However, cone-beam CT often shows moderately long acquisition time, making it susceptible to motion artifacts that could significantly degrade the accuracy of 4D-DSA. Recent developments in motion compensation with image-based autofocus, integrating learning-based autofocus metrics and implicit neural representation of the motion trajectory, has demonstrated reliable and robust performance in solving complex motion in CBCT images. In this work, we propose a novel framework that incorporates motion compensation into the 4D-DSA pipeline. 4D-DSA is obtained via a multi-stage approach involving deep autofocus motion estimation acting on the non-contrast-enhanced mask, simultaneous motion estimation and registration of the contrast-enhanced volume, and estimation of the time-dependent volumetric contrast distribution.
