Hello and welcome! My name is Heyuan Huang, currently a Ph.D. candidate at Biomedical Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins University. 

My reseach topics include:

* Machine learning 
* X-ray computed tomography
* Motion compensation
* Interventional Radiology

My current projects focus on using learning-based methods for motion compensation in interventional cone-beam CT, addressing the one of the most difficult challenges facing CBCT imaging.

Please feel free to checkout the resume/CV and research section of this website for more details about my research and skills. Or, if you are interested, you are very welcome to check out the About Me section for the fun side of me (teaser: I'm actually also a music producer).
